# UFO's Cheat Mods Bundle For Bannerlord [Beta 1.3.1]

My original goal was to learn how to make mods. It just so happened that the 'crush through' feature I wanted stopped working, so I decompiled it and combined it with several well-known mods. I noticed that many people were also sad about some wanted features no longer working, so I decided to release this mod directly.
